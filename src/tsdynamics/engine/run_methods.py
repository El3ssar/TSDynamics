"""Solver-method resolution + auto-stiffness — the ``method=`` contract.

Split out of :mod:`tsdynamics.engine.run` (the run-split refactor); every name
here stays reachable as ``tsdynamics.engine.run.<name>`` via re-export, so this is
a pure move.

This module owns the shared ``method=`` resolution both :func:`integrate` and
:func:`ensemble` route through, so ``"auto"`` (a-priori auto-stiffness),
spelling/alias normalisation ("RK45" → "rk45", "dopri5" → "rk45"), v2-only-name
rejection ("LSODA"), and the implicit-kernel Jacobian rebuild behave identically
across both entry points (diagnosis #11/#13).

The problem-coercion helper (``_as_problem``) is late-imported from
:mod:`tsdynamics.engine.run` inside the functions that need it, so importing this
module does not create an import cycle.

    """Resolve ``method="auto"`` to a kernel by a-priori auto-stiffness selection.

    The auto-stiffness wiring (ticket FIX-AUTOSTIFF) applies to **ODEs only**:
    probe the problem's Jacobian spectrum at its start state and let the solver
    registry recommend an implicit kernel (``bdf``) on a stiff RHS or the explicit
    default (``rk45``) otherwise (:func:`tsdynamics.solvers.recommend`).  The probe
    is the one-point heuristic :func:`tsdynamics.solvers.is_stiff` — useful but not
    a guarantee (see its docstring): the verdict is read at the problem's resolved
    start state (``problem.ic``) and at ``problem.t0`` (``0.0`` unless a builder set
    it; the integrate/ensemble ``t0=`` argument is not threaded here).  A system
    declares a stiff default via ``_default_method`` when the heuristic is too
    coarse for it.

    Maps and DDEs treat ``"auto"`` as an explicit, documented **no-op** — it
    resolves to the family default rather than probing:

    - **Maps** iterate without a solver kernel, so the resolved kernel is ignored
      by the map branch (``"auto"`` simply does not raise).
    - **DDEs** are driven by the method of steps, which reuses the *explicit*
      stage kernels only.  A stiffness probe would be meaningless **and** a trap:
      :func:`tsdynamics.solvers.is_stiff` reads only the *instantaneous* Jacobian
      ``∂f/∂u``, ignoring the delay terms that actually shape a DDE's spectrum, so
      a spurious "stiff" verdict could otherwise select the implicit
      ``rosenbrock`` the DDE engine cannot drive.  ``"auto"`` therefore resolves to
      the DDE default (``rk45``); a delay system that genuinely needs another
      explicit kernel should pass ``method=`` explicitly.

    SDEs never reach here (the SDE path refuses ``run.integrate`` upstream).
